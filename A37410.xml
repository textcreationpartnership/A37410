            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis pre≈øent day the King's Attorney-General came into the Court of Parliament, and alledged, that the Report being publickly ≈øpread up and down, That the Pope had enjoyned the <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Je≈øuits,</hi> to direct to the <hi>Provincials</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical Copies of the <hi>Brief</hi> i≈ø≈øued out by his Holine≈øs, on the fir≈øt day of this pre≈øent year, together with a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Injunction to him of <hi>Tholou≈øe,</hi> to publi≈øh it, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige tho≈øe of that Society, to affirm the Reality of the ≈øaid Brief, contrary to the Opinion, which we were de≈øirous that men ≈øhould ≈øtill have had of it; As al≈øo that the <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Je≈øuits</hi> having written to tho≈øe <hi>Provincials,</hi> pur≈øuantly to that Precept of the Pope, had ≈øent to him of <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical Expedition of that <hi>Brief,</hi> with an Order that it might be communicated to that of <hi>Paris:</hi> This new Method and Invention of publi≈øhing <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Briefs</hi> in the Kingdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Forms which had been ob≈øerved to this pre≈øent time; as well in this as the neighbouring Countreys, ≈øeem'd to be of ≈øo great con≈øequence, that he accounted it his duty to inform the Court of it, to the end, that if that Report prov'd to be true, they might be pleas'd to ob≈øtruct the e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhment of an Innovation, the Con≈øequences whereof might be ≈øo dangerous, and particularly at ≈øuch a time, when ≈øuch

            </head>
            <p>THis day the King's Council came into Court, and gave notice, that Father <hi>de Verthamont, Superiour</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs'd Hou≈øe</hi> of the <hi>Je≈øuits,</hi> of this City of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Fathers <hi>De≈øchamps,</hi> and <hi>Dozaine,</hi> Rectors of the Colledge, and of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57843:3"/>
               <hi>Noviciat,</hi> and Father <hi>Pallu,</hi> Procurator of the Province of <hi>France,</hi> were attending in the <hi>Lobby,</hi> in order to their recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the plea≈øure of the Court, according to the Re≈øolve of the 18th. of that Month: Whereupon the ≈øaid Father-<hi>Je≈øuit,</hi> being brought into the pre≈øence of the King's Council, <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur</hi> the fir≈øt Pre≈øident thus ≈øpoke to them:</p>
            <p>This Court hath ≈øummon'd you to appear here, upon the Adverti≈øement given to us, that your General hath not long ≈øince ≈øent into <hi>France,</hi> by the Pope's Order, to ≈øome of your Provincials, a pretended <hi>Brief,</hi> in order to the publi≈øhing of it. This kind of procedure, quite oppo≈øite to the Orders of the Kingdom, has always been di≈øallow'd with Reproach again≈øt its Authors, as often as they have attempted to put it in practice. It is a ≈øtrange thing that a Prince, who has not ceas'd conquering, till ≈øuch time as he was pleas'd to do ≈øo, and who has given Peace to <hi>Europe</hi> cannot enjoy it him≈øelf, and that he is not di≈øturbed therein, but by the principal Mini≈øters of Truth, while he expends his Cares and Trea≈øures for the De≈øtruction of Here≈øie: But it is a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, that this Pacquet is fallen into Hands ≈øo re≈øerv'd as yours: We do not ≈øurprize your Wi≈ødom, nor do we corrupt your Fidelity. The Court de≈øires of you, that you would make it a Relation of what has pa≈øs'd upon this occa≈øion.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Verthamont</hi> acknowledg'd, that their Provincial had receiv'd a Letter from their General of the 23d. of <hi>April</hi> la≈øt, with a Copy in the <hi>Italian</hi> Language, of an Order of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s, for the directing, to the Provincial of <hi>Tholou≈øe,</hi> a Copy, in an Authentical Form, of his Holine≈ø≈øe's <hi>Brief</hi> of the fir≈øt of <hi>January</hi> this pre≈øent year, concerning the Grand-Vicars, e≈øtabli≈øh'd in the Dioce≈øe of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> during the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the See, and for enjoyning the <hi>Je≈øuits</hi> of <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> and <hi>Pamiers</hi> to declare, that the ≈øaid Brief was real, and to addre≈øs a Copy of it, to the Provincial of <hi>Paris,</hi> that he might al≈øo be a≈ø≈øur'd of the Reality thereof. And by that Order, the General is charg'd to give an Account, to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57843:4"/>A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor of the Inqui≈øition, of the An≈øwers which ≈øhould be made unto him. That in the ≈øame Pacquet, there was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned Copy of that <hi>Brief.</hi> That he him≈øelf knew, that, by by way of An≈øwer to the General's Letter, their Provincial had, among other things, written to him, that he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any one of his Society would would have been ≈øo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, as to make any diminution of the re≈øpect they owe his Holine≈øs, as he might al≈øo a≈ø≈øure the Court, on the behalf of all the <hi>Je≈øuits</hi> of the Kingdom, that they ≈øhould not ever be defective in point of Fidelity and Zeal for his Maje≈øty.</p>
            <p>Whereupon Mon≈øieur <hi>Denys Talon,</hi> the King's Advocate, and one of his Council ≈øpoke thus: Sirs, It is apparent by what has been ju≈øt now ≈øaid, by the Superior of the <hi>Je≈øuits</hi> Hou≈øe of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> in this City, That the General of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuits</hi> had receiv'd an Order from the Pope, for his ≈øending to the Provincials of the <hi>Je≈øuits</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Tholou≈øe,</hi> an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical Copy of a Brief, dated the fir≈øt day of this pre≈øent year, which is pre≈øuppos'd to be directed to the Chapter of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> and to Friar <hi>Cerle,</hi> in the quality of the Grand Vicar of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> during the Vacancy of the See, and that with a De≈øign, that the <hi>Je≈øuits</hi> of <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> and <hi>Pamiers,</hi> who, as it is pretended by ≈øome, had publickly affirm'd, that the ≈øaid Brief was not real, ≈øhould be oblig'd to retract it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs the reality of the Brief, and to acknowledge withal the fault they have committed by an affected Incredulity, and they would have it, that the General ≈øhould give an Account to the A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor of the Inqui≈øition of the An≈øwers which ≈øhall be made unto him. This Order, which does not appear to have any Date, is accompany'd with a Copy of the Brief, but not Signed, and by a Letter of the General's, repeating the ≈øame thing contained in the Pope's Order. It is ea≈øily di≈øcoverable by this ≈øimple Expo≈øition of the matter of Fact, that this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of de≈øigning to publi≈øh, and in ≈øome ≈øort to execute Briefs in the Kingdom, is new, contrary to the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and of a dangerous Con≈øequence. It is not only in <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57843:4"/>that Briefs and other important Expeditions of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be either publi≈øh'd or put in Execution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King's permi≈ø≈øion. The ≈øame thing is practic'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in mo≈øt of the other Countreys, wherein the Authority of the Holy See is acknowledg'd.</p>
            <p>The Corre≈øpondence which ought to be between the two Powers, the Intere≈øt which Sovereign Princes have to prevent the Introduction of any thing from abroad, tending to the di≈øturbance of the Tranquility of their Governments, has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd this Cu≈øtom legal and nece≈ø≈øary: But that wi≈øe precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which many times di≈øpen≈øes with our entring into more intricate Conte≈øtations, would be of no Advantage, if the Contrivance which they have made u≈øe of at <hi>Rome,</hi> in order to the publi≈øhing of the <hi>Brief</hi> of the fir≈øt of <hi>January</hi> be autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized; in regard that, as often as there ≈øhall be any <hi>Bulls,</hi> which they would have received in the Kingdom, and yet ≈øuch as whereof his Maje≈øty will not think convenient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit either the Execution or Publication, they will make u≈øe of the interpo≈øition of the <hi>Generalls</hi> of Orders, who, for the mo≈øt part have their Re≈øidence at <hi>Rome.</hi> And the Pope by, their Channell, will pretend to get into <hi>France</hi> all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the <hi>Inqui≈øition,</hi> and in a word, all the Encroachments which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would make upon our Liberties.</p>
            <p>It is therefore nece≈ø≈øary to check the cour≈øe of ≈øo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Innovation; which yet may be done with ≈øo much the more ea≈øe, that, as to that concern, there is not any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity of e≈øtabli≈øhing new Laws. It is only requi≈øite that we keep our ≈øelves from di≈øpen≈øing with the ob≈øervation of the ancient Ordinances, which do not allow of the publication of any <hi>Brief</hi> or <hi>Bull,</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> without the King's permi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion. And this is done in ≈øome Provinces with ≈øo much Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, that the very ≈øimple Signatures of Provi≈øions of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are not exempted from that General Order, whether they come from <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Legation of <hi>Avignon.</hi> What we do in this Juncture for the Publick Intere≈øt, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øties
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57843:5"/>Service, proceeds not from our having Cau≈øe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the <hi>Je≈øuits;</hi> the Reproaches which they receive in the Direction, written in the <hi>Pope's</hi> Name, and in their <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's</hi> Letter, ought, among≈øt us, to ≈øtand them in≈øtead of an Elogy, and are certain Proofs, that they have not devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their Duty. And therefore ≈øince it may be ≈øome di≈ø≈øatisfaction to them, that they cannot ≈øubmit to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Pope</hi> and their <hi>General,</hi> in ca≈øe they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, how oppo≈øite that Order is to the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it is but ju≈øt that we relieve them, and rid them out of the perplexity, which they might run into by the Authority of the Decree which will be pa≈øs'd. But if we have not hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to u≈øed endeavours to prevent the Publication of the Brief of the fir≈øt of <hi>January;</hi> if we have look'd upon the Copies, which have been ≈øcatter'd up and down of it in <hi>Paris,</hi> rather as Libels, than Copies of an authentical Act, it has not been out of any Fear, but is to be attributed to our mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as being inclineable to doubt of their reality. We ≈øhall not want Remedies to oppo≈øe Enterprizes of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when it ≈øhall not be allowable in us to connive at them any longer. We ≈øhall u≈øe our utmo≈øt endeavours to continue the good Corre≈øpondence which ought to be between His Maje≈øty and the Pope, between the <hi>Holy See,</hi> and the <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane Church;</hi> and whatever may happen, we ≈øhall never, on our part, make a Breach of that Sacred Union of the <hi>Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal</hi> Function, and the <hi>Royalty,</hi> ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary to keep up the Splendor of both the Powers, and to pre≈øerve and dilate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>But on the other ≈øide, we ≈øhall not endure the Impo≈øition of a Yoke, which our Fathers have not undergone, nor the Abolition of our Liberties, of which they were ≈øo jealous. We ≈øhall never approve of any Alteration in the Order of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødictions. When the Pope receives Appeals from Eccle≈øia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtical Judgments, he is oblig'd to nominate Judges in the Kingdom, for the termination of them, and he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57843:5"/>affairs there at fir≈øt breaking out, nor retain the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance thereof at <hi>Rome,</hi> whether it be in reference to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of Elections, or even of Appeals from Sentences given by Bi≈øhops, or other Officials. As we are inclin'd to a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ob≈øervation of the <hi>Concordate,</hi> and do tolerate Re≈øignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in favour, Preventions, <hi>Annates</hi> (that is annual Tenths) though contrary to the ancient di≈øcipline of the Church; So ought the Pope to execute it on his ≈øide al≈øo, in the things that are favourable to us, which we do not look upon as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges granted us by <hi>Rome,</hi> but as the exerci≈øe of common right, and as the Ground-work of our Immunities. And it is thereby ea≈øily perceivable, that tho≈øe per≈øons, who are the Authors of the Brief of the fir≈øt of <hi>January,</hi> and of many others, which have appear'd upon this matter, engage the Pope in conte≈øts more likely to retrench his Authority, than to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, and ≈øeem to have no other de≈øign, than that of di≈øtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Peace of the Church. In ≈øhort, the <hi>Regale</hi> being one of the mo≈øt eminent rights of the Crown, how can they hope that the King will ever endure that that Illu≈øtrious Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ≈øhould, during his Reign, admit of the lea≈øt ≈øhock or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution? Your own Records acquaint you, that the <hi>Regale</hi> was always ≈øo con≈øider'd as a right of the Crown, unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and impre≈øcriptible, that King <hi>Francis</hi> the Fir≈øt, having left Madam <hi>Loui≈øe</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> his Mother, Regent in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and having, among≈øt other things, inve≈øted her with a power to confer Benefices, vacant in the Regal donation, ≈øhe was oblig'd to renounce that Priviledge, upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrances of the Parlement, who repre≈øented to her, that the right of conferring Benefices, in the Regal Donation, was ≈øo annex'd to the King's Per≈øon, that he could never part with it, or communicate it to any other. The Judgment of particular, or general Controver≈øies, ari≈øing in the matters of the <hi>Regale,</hi> do belong, and ever have belong'd to this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable A≈ø≈øembly, privatively to all other Tribunals of the Kingdom. It was your Honourable Body judg'd it above ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57843:6"/>years ≈øince, that the <hi>Regale</hi> extended over all Bi≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks, without any di≈øtinction; and the Declarations of MDCLXXIII, and MDCLXXV, do not make any new E≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhment, and do but confirm your Decree. So that we may confidently affirm, that how great ≈øoever the King's Authority may be, yet he can no more renounce the <hi>Regale,</hi> either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in part, than he can de≈øtroy the <hi>Salick Law,</hi> or aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Sovereignty of ≈øome part of the Provinces, which make up and integrate the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy; and what ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion ≈øoever we may have for his Will and Plea≈øure, we ≈øhall rather be≈øeech him to di≈øburthen us of the Exerci≈øe of our Charges, than endure, that that Priviledge ≈øhould receive the lea≈øt Diminution by our Suffrages, or our Silence. There is not any nece≈ø≈øity that a man ≈øhould be much vers'd in our Maxims, to di≈øcover, that it is not at <hi>Rome</hi> the≈øe Que≈øtions ought to be di≈øcu≈øs'd, and that whatever has been hitherto done, either on the account of the Pope, or his Officers, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually unmaintainable, as well in the form, as the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of it. 'Tis to no purpo≈øe that they menace with <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> not only the Eccle≈øia≈øticks, but the very Prelates of the Kingdom, when they do not implicitely ≈øubmit to Briefs contrary to our manners, and ≈øuch as would ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely aboli≈øh the Epi≈øcopal Juri≈ødiction, if the Execution thereof were permitted. Appeals, in the ca≈øe of abu≈øes, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to maintain the Policy of the Church, and to ob≈øtruct the u≈øurpations of the Officers of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the Temporal and Eccle≈øia≈øtical Juri≈ødiction, are infallible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients to ≈øecure all the King's Subjects from tho≈øe Cen≈øures, which our Ance≈øtors have ≈ølighted, and declared abu≈øive, when there was no legal Ground for them.</p>
            <p>Having thus prote≈øted, as we do, that we ≈øhall u≈øe all the means, which we ≈øhall think convenient, to check the cour≈øe of all the≈øe Innovations, and to put a period to attempts ≈øo prejudicial to the King's Authority, and the Immunities of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church; It is our reque≈øt, that the Court will
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57843:6"/>be pleas'd to order the Copy of the <hi>Brief</hi> of the fir≈øt of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> the <hi>Italian Memoirs</hi> ≈øent to the General of the <hi>Je≈øuits,</hi> and the Letter by him written to the Provincial of the Province of <hi>Fance,</hi> to be regi≈øtred among≈øt the Records of the Court, to the end, that after Communication had of them what is fitting may be required; That there be a prohibition i≈ø≈øued out to the <hi>Provincial,</hi> and to all the <hi>Superiours</hi> of the Hou≈øes of the <hi>Je≈øuits,</hi> again≈øt the publi≈øhing of the ≈øaid <hi>Brief, Letters,</hi> and <hi>Memoires,</hi> and doing any thing as to the Execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, directly or indirectly, under any pretence what≈øoever, upon pain of an extraordinary procedure again≈øt tho≈øe who ≈øhall not obey, as di≈øturbers of the publick tranquillity; as al≈øo upon pain, as to the Society, of the Forfeiture of all the rights, priviledges, and prerogatives, which are attributed thereto, as well by its e≈øtabli≈øhment, as otherwi≈øe.
